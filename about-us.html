<h2>Mission: clarity about mental health hospital pathways</h2>
<p>This website exists to provide clear, evidence-informed guidance on psychiatric hospital services, care pathways, and treatment options available in Canada. Our mission is to demystify the mental health system, reduce confusion for patients and families, and empower individuals with practical knowledge grounded in Canadian health system realities.</p>
<p>Mental health care can be complex and difficult to navigate. Terminology is often technical, access pathways vary by province and region, and the range of services—from inpatient psychiatric care to outpatient therapy to crisis intervention—can be overwhelming. We aim to present this information in plain language, organized around real-world questions and scenarios, so that anyone seeking help can understand what to expect and how to take the next step.</p>
<p>While many people search for location-specific terms such as mental health hospital montreal or the names of specific institutions, this site is designed as a general informational resource for all of Canada. We do not provide medical advice, emergency response, or appointment booking. Instead, we explain how the system works, what services are available, and where to turn for official guidance and care.</p>

<h2>What we cover (and what we do not)</h2>
<p>This site covers a broad range of topics related to psychiatric hospital services in Canada, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inpatient psychiatric services:</strong> What they are, who they serve, how admission works, and what to expect during a hospital stay.</li>
<li><strong>Outpatient mental health programs:</strong> Types of outpatient care, how to access them, and what ongoing treatment looks like in the community.</li>
<li><strong>Crisis intervention services:</strong> When to seek emergency help, what crisis teams do, and how to access urgent psychiatric care.</li>

<section id="accessibility">
<h2>Accessibility and usability commitments</h2>
<p>We believe that mental health information should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability, device, or connection speed. This site is built with semantic HTML5, ensuring that content is structured logically and can be navigated by screen readers and other assistive technologies. We use clear heading hierarchies, descriptive link text, and keyboard-accessible navigation.</p>
<p>Our design prioritizes readability, with a clean typographic scale, ample white space, and high contrast between text and background. We respect user preferences for reduced motion and provide focus indicators for keyboard navigation. Tables are marked up with proper headers and captions to ensure they are understandable in all contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are committed to clear navigation, plain language, and accessible design. Mental health information should be easy to find, easy to read, and easy to act on—for everyone.</p>
